<p>Cascadia Code is a fun open source font that originated from the Windows Terminal project as a replacement for Consolas. It was intended to bring personality to monospace environemnts (especially in the italic!), while still maintaining a high degree of legibility and performance even on lower resolution screens at smaller sizes. It also offers broad language coverage, including extended Latin (and Vietnamese), Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic and Hebrew.</p>

<p>Cascadia Code also has an alternate version available—Cascadia Mono—which has the programming ligatures disabled for those who prefer to see one glyph per square.</p>
