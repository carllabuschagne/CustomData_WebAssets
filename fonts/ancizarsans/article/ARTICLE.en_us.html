    UNAL Ancízar is a highly versatile and legible typeface family, initially designed in 2014 to strengthen the
    institutional image of Universidad Nacional de Colombia, the country's largest public university. This typeface was
    initially designed by Professor César Puertas (Faculty of Arts, Bogotá Campus), Viviana Monsalve, and Julián
    Moncada, within the framework of a project led by Professor Jaime Franky Rodríguez (Director of the Communications &
    Media Unity - UNIMEDIOS), Martha Lucía Chaves Muñoz (Head of the Digital Media Office), and María Teresa Naranjo
    Castillo (Institutional Image Coordinator). In 2024, the University released the typeface family under the
    leadership of Professor Jaime Rodolfo Ramírez Rodríguez (director of UNIMEDIOS), to transcend the institution and
    constitute a contribution from UNAL to humanity.

    Naturally diverse, the UNAL Ancízar type family is designed for daily use in almost any condition. All fonts share a
    common structure that enhances both readability and identity, while a broad range of weights ensures adaptability
    for various needs. UNAL Ancízar is not only optimized for challenging print environments—its streamlined curves also
    perform exceptionally well on digital screens, giving text a unique personality that helps distinguish the
    university from others.

    The UNAL Ancízar type family is divided into two groups: Serif and Sans Serif, enhancing its versatility and
    adaptability to various applications. The Serif fonts are designed for long texts, such as essays and articles,
    while the Sans Serif variants excel in signage and headlines, ensuring optimal performance in shorter texts. Its
    robust typographic repertoire—including diacritics, small caps, and uppercase and lowercase numerals—ensures broad
    functionality.

    With nine weights, Ancízar offers a diverse range of styles, making it easier to select the right variant for each
    context. Its extensive character set (1,043 per font) supports Western Latin, monotonic Greek, and the International
    Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). Beyond meeting institutional requirements, this typographic richness allows the university
    community to explore and express its creativity with greater freedom.

    extend our gratitude to Julián Prieto Velandia, José Castro Garnica, Mariel Hernández Camino, Felipe Aragón Rubio,
