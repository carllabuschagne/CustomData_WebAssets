<p>Bytesized is a miniscule monospace pixel font - 3x4 modulo diacritics - made to be as legible as possible within these restrictions.</p>

<p>The name comes from the fact that, if you restrict the font to ASCII only, you can store it raw in just under 150 bytes!</p>

<p>While a few compromises had to be made to fit it into such a small profile, namely only supporting the Latin Core character set, and some "creative" glyph designs, so to speak, it's still quite readable!</p>
