    Winky Rough is the roughed variant of Winky Sans (https://github.com/typofactur/winkysans) imitating dried ink on rough paper.
</p>
<p>
    Winky Rough is a variable font with a weight axis that ranges from Light (300) to Black (900) and has matching italic styles.
</p>
<p>
    But be careful! Like flowing ink on paper the forms grows in all directions. While the slim weights might have been written with a fineliner, the black style look like ink blots from a broken pen.
