<p><strong>Coral Pixels</strong> is a color font inspired by subpixel rendering techniques. It elevates the retro pixel font style commonly seen in games and digital art by infusing it with color, creating a more vibrant and dynamic digital aesthetic. Beyond being merely a font, it offers a new dimension for visual expression.
<ul>
    <li><strong>Subpixel Rendering Expression:</strong> By applying display technology to font design, Coral Pixels creates a depth and dimensionality not typically found in traditional fonts. This innovative approach could inspire new ideas for retro game pixel art.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Rich Color Expression:</strong> The font's glyphs, when viewed from a distance, appear as blurred black text. However, upon closer inspection, they reveal a random arrangement of colorful dots, offering a unique and visually engaging experience.</li>

    <li><strong>Transparency Implementation:</strong> Coral Pixels incorporates transparency into its color elements to minimize the occurrence of unsightly fringes. While this design choice enhances the font's appearance, it can result in a loss of color vibrancy when used against dark backgrounds. As a temporary workaround, we recommend using color inversion or other adjustments within your application.</li>
</ul>
