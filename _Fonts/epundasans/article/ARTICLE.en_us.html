    Epunda Sans is a simple sans serif font. Its characteristic features are its slanted indentations. It is an unadorned but friendly font that remains easy to read even at small font sizes and on screens thanks to its high x-height and large interior spaces.
</p>
<p>
    Epunda Sans was originally designed by Simon Atzbach in 2007, based on the completely symmetric Epunda. In 2022 it was redesigned as a variable font.
</p>
<p>
    The variable font has a weight axis that ranges from Light (300) to Black (900).
